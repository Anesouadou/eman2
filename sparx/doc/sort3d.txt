= Name =
sxsort3d.py-sort out 3-D heterogeneity of 2-D data whose 3-D reconstruction parameters (xform.projection) have been determined already using 3-D sorting protocol I (P1).

= Usage =
 mpirun   -np  176  --host n1,n5,n6,n8,n9,n10,n0,n4,n3,n7     sxsort3d.py  bdb:data  sort3d_outdir1   mask.hdf     --focus=ribosome_focus.hdf --chunkdir=/data/n10/pawel/ribosome_frank/ri3/main013    --radius=52   --CTF   --number_of_images_per_group=2000    --low_pass_filter=.125   --stoprnct=5 
 


== Input ==
    bdb:data:: input stack file
    mask.hdf:: mask_file

== Output ==
    sort3d_outdir :: the master dir that contains multiple subdirectories. There is a log.txt that describes the sequences of computations in the program.
  

== Options ==
    --chunkdir:: two chunks of arbitrary assigned data while refined independently during the 3-D reconstruction. .
    --radius:: radius of the particles
    --number_of_images_per_group:: number of images in a group, the critical number defined by user.
    --low_pass_filter:: user defined low pass filter. 
    --focus:: focus mask.
    --stopprnct:: percentages of changed number of particles during one cycle.

= Description =

The clustering algorithm in the program combines a couple of computational techniques, equal-Kmeans clustering, K-means clustering, and reproducibility of clustering such that it not only has a strong ability but also a high efficiency to sort out heterogeneity of cryo-EM images. The command sxsort3d.py is the protocol I {P1). In this protocol, the user defines the group size and thus defines the number of group K. Then the total data is randomly assigned into K group and an equal-size K-means (size restricted K-means) is carried out. N independent equal-Kmeans runs would give N partition of the K groups assignment. Then two-way comparison of these partitions gives the reproducible number of particles.

= Maturity =

    stable while under development:: Two programs (P1,P2) have been tested on both simulated and experimental ribosome data. For experimental ribosome data, P2 has a reproducible ratio-70-90%. P2 can 100%separate two conformations from the simulated ribosome data that contains 5 conformations. 

= Bugs =
None.  It is perfect.
