= Description =

The clustering algorithm in the program combines a couple of computational techniques, equal-Kmeans clustering, K-means clustering, and reproducibility of clustering such that it not only has a strong ability but also a high efficiency to sort out heterogeneity of cryo-EM images. The command sxsort3d.py is the protocol I {P1). In this protocol, the user defines the group size and thus defines the number of group K. Then the total data is randomly assigned into K group and an equal-size K-means (size restricted K-means) is carried out. N independent equal-Kmeans runs would give N partition of the K groups assignment. Then two-way comparison of these partitions gives the reproducible number of particles.

= Maturity =

    stable while under development:: Two programs (P1,P2) have been tested on both simulated and experimental ribosome data. For experimental ribosome data, P2 has a reproducible ratio-70-90%. P2 can 100%separate two conformations from the simulated ribosome data that contains 5 conformations. 

= Bugs =
None.  It is perfect.
