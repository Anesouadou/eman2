    yr:: Y search range [Pixels]: The translational search range in the y direction. If omitted it will be set as xr. (default -1)
    ts:: Translational search step [Pixels]: The search will be performed in -xr, -xr+ts, 0, xr-ts, xr, can be fractional. (default 0.25)
    an:: Local angular search width [Degrees]: This defines the neighbourhood where the local angular search will be performed. (default '-1')
    center:: Centering method: 0 - if you do not want the volume to be centered, 1 - center the volume using the center of gravity. (default 0)

= Description =

The clustering algorithm in the program combines a couple of computational techniques, equal-Kmeans clustering, K-means clustering, and reproducibility of clustering such that it not only has a strong ability but also a high efficiency to sort out heterogeneity of cryo-EM images. The command sxsort3d.py is the protocol I {P1). In this protocol, the user defines the group size and thus defines the number of group K. Then the total data is randomly assigned into K group and an equal-size K-means (size restricted K-means) is carried out. N independent equal-Kmeans runs would give N partition of the K groups assignment. Then two-way comparison of these partitions gives the reproducible number of particles.

= Maturity =

    stable while under development:: Two programs (P1,P2) have been tested on both simulated and experimental ribosome data. For experimental ribosome data, P2 has a reproducible ratio-70-90%. P2 can 100%separate two conformations from the simulated ribosome data that contains 5 conformations.
