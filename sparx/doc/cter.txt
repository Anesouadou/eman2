''usage in command line''

sxcter.py  input_image  output_directory  --wn=CTF_WINDOW_SIZE --apix=PIXEL_SIZE  --Cs=CS  --voltage=VOLTAGE  --ac=AMP_CONTRAST  --f_start=FREA_START  --f_stop=FREQ_STOP  --kboot=KBOOT  --overlap_x=OVERLAP_X  --overlap_y=OVERLAP_Y  --edge_x=EDGE_X  --edge_y=EDGE_Y  --set_ctf_header  --MPI  --stack_mode  --debug  


=== Typical usage ===

sxcter exists in for both MPI and non-MPI versions.


    Multi-Micrograph Mode - Processes a set of micrographs in a list file or in a directory:: Specify a micrograph list file name (e.g. output of sxgui_unblur.py or sxgui_cter.py) and output directory as arguments. The file extension must be ".txt".

    ''' mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py mic_list.txt outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --MPI ''' <<BR>><<BR>>

    Alternatively, specify a list of input micrographs and their corresponding coordinates using wild card (e.g. *). Running from the command line requires enclosing the string by single quotes (') or double quotes ("). sxgui.py will automatically adds single quotes to the string (').  BDB stacks can not be used as input.

    ''' mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py 'Micrographs/mic*.mrc' outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --MPI ''' <<BR>><<BR>>

    Single-Micrograph Mode - Processes a single micrograph:: Only the micrograph name and output directory are used as arguments. BDB files can not be selected as input micrograph. Use single processor for this mode. 

    ''' sxcter.py Micrographs/mic0.mrc outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 ''' <<BR>><<BR>>

    Stack Mode - Processes a particle stack:: Use option --stack_mode. The name of the particle stack and output directory are used as arguments. The --wn option will be ignored. This mode is Not supported by sxgui.py. Only implemented in the non-MPI version of sxcter. 

    ''' sxcter.py bdb:stack outdir_cter --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --stack_mode ''' <<BR>><<BR>>


== Input ==
    input_image:: Input micrographs: For the multi-micrograph mode, specify micrograph list file name or file name pattern with a wild card (i.e. *). A particle stack can also be supplied with --stack_mode, but this mode is not supported by sxgui. Images of bdb format can not be used. (default required string)
    
    wn:: CTF window size [Pixels]: It should be slightly larger than particle box size. This is ignored in the stack mode. (default 512)
    apix:: Pixel size [A]: (default -1.0)
    Cs:: Microscope spherical aberration [mm]: (default 2.0)
    voltage:: Microscope voltage [kV]: (default 300.0)
    ac:: Amplitude contrast [%]: (default 10.0)
    f_start:: Starting frequency [1/A]: Lowest frequency to be considered in the CTF estimation. Determined automatically by default. (default -1.0)
    f_stop:: Stop frequency [1/A]: by Highest frequency to be considered in the CTF estimation. Determined automatically by default. (default -1.0)

    * The remaining parameters are optional.
    kboot:: Number of estimates per micrograph: Used for error assessment. (default 16)
    overlap_x:: X overlap [%]: Overlap between the windows in the x direction. (default 50)
    overlap_y:: Y overlap [%]: Overlap between the windows in the y direction. (default 50)
    edge_x:: Edge x [Pixels]: Defines the edge of the tiling area in the x direction. Normally it does not need to be modified. (default 0)
    edge_y:: Edge y [Pixels]: Defines the edge of the tiling area in the y direction. Normally it does not need to be modified. (default 0)
    set_ctf_header:: Export parameters to header: Exports the estimated CTF parameters to the image header. Not supported in the particle stack mode. (default False)
    MPI:: Use MPI: (default False)
    stack_mode:: Use stack mode: Advanced option. Not supported by sxgui. (default False)
    debug:: Debug info: Prints debug information. (default False)


== Output ==
    output_directory:: Output directory: The CTF parameters (partres file), rotationally averaged power spectra (rotinf), and micrograph thumbnails (thumb files) will be written here. This directory will be created automatically and it must not exist previously. (default required string)


After successful execution, sxcter will create in the output_directory: 

 1. A CTF parameters file, written to ''partres.txt''<<BR>><<BR>>
 2. A list of rotationally averaged power spectra, written to ''pwrot/*_rotinf.txt''.<<BR>><<BR>>
 3. A collection of micrographs Thumbnails (512 x 512 pixels), written to ''micthumb/*_thumb.hdf''.<<BR>><<BR>>


The CTF parameter file, ''partres.txt'', contains 18 columns with the following information:<<BR>><<BR>>

|| Column || Parameter ||
|| 1 || Image defocus [um] ||
|| 2 || Microscope spherical aberration [mm] ||
|| 3 || Microscope voltage [kV] ||
|| 4 || Pixel size [A] ||
|| 5 || B-factor [A^2] ||
|| 6 || Amplitude contrast [%] ||
|| 7 || Astigmatism amplitude [um] ||
|| 8 || Astigmatism angle [degrees] ||
|| 9 || Standard deviation of defocus [um] ||
|| 10 || Standard deviation of astigmatism amplitude [um] ||
|| 11 || Standard deviation of astigmatism angle [degrees] ||
|| 12 || Coefficient of variation of defocus [um] ||
|| 13 || Coefficient of variation of astigmatism amplitude [um] ||
|| 14 || Mean difference between the experimental rotational averages calculated with and without considering astigmatism. The subtraction is only performed at frequencies where the CTF model has a local minimum or maximum. ||
|| 15 || Frequency at which the signal drops by 50% due to estimated error of defocus alone [1/A] ||
|| 16 || Frequency at which the signal drops by 50% due to estimated error of defocus and astigmatism [1/A] ||
|| 17 || Frequency at which the CTF oscillation can no longer be modelled correctly due the pixel size of the image [1/A] ||
|| 18 || Micrograph name ||

<<BR>><<BR>>
The rotationally averaged power spectra (rotinf.txt files) will be written to the pwrot directory. These files contain 6 columns with the following information:<<BR>><<BR>>


|| Column || Parameter ||
|| 1 || Line number ||
|| 2 || Spatial frequency [1/A] ||
|| 3 || Experimental rotational average without considering astigmatism ||
|| 4 || Fitted rotational average without considering astigmatism ||
|| 5 || Experimental rotational average including astigmatism ||
|| 6 || Fitted rotational average including astigmatism ||
