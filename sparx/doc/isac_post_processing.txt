''Usage in command lines'':

sxisac_post_processing.py  stack_file  isac_directory  --radius=particle_radius  --CTF 

=== Typical usage ===

sxisac_post_processing.py exists only in MPI version

''' mpirun  -np  32  sxisac_post_processing.py  bdb:data  fisac1  locres.hdf  --radius=28 '''


== Input ==
    stack_file:: Original image stack: Particles required to create the full-sized class averages. The images must be square (''nx''=''ny'') and the stack must be bdb format (default required string)
    isac_directory:: Isac output directory: Name of the directory where isac was run previously. (default required string)

    radius:: Particle radius [Pixels]: There is no default radius. (default required int)
    CTF:: Phase-flip: If set, the data will be phase-flipped using CTF information included in the image headers. (default False)

    * The remaining parameters are optional.
