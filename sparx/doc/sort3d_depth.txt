=== Typical usage ===

sxsort3d_depth.py exists only in MPI version. It surports single node workstation. 

There are three ways of running it. 

    1. 3D sorting from meridien iteration: Run from a fully finished iteration of meridien run and imports data from there. This mode uses all meridien information (i.e., smear, normalizations and such).
   
    ''' mpirun -np 48 sxsort3d_depth.py --refinement_dir='outdir_sxmeridien' --output_dir='outdir_sxsort3d_depth_iteration' --radius=52 --sym='c1' --memory_per_node=60.0 --img_per_grp=2000 --minimum_grp_size=1500 --stop_mgskmeans_percentage=10.0 --swap_ratio=5 --do_swap_au --shake=0.1 ''' <<BR>><<BR>>    

    2. 3D sorting from stack: Run from user-provided orientation parameters stored in stack header.  This mode uses only orientation parameters, which is useful for sorting data refined say with relion.
   
    ''' mpirun -np 48 sxsort3d_depth.py --instack='bdb:data' --output_dir='outdir_sxsort3d_depth_stack' --radius=52 --sym='c1' --img_per_grp=2000 --minimum_grp_size=1500 --stop_mgskmeans_percentage=10.0 --swap_ratio=5 --do_swap_au ''' <<BR>><<BR>>

    3. Post-sorting sharpening: Reconstruct unfiltered maps from a list of selection files and merge the two halves maps, so that users can adjust B-factors and low-pass filter to have proper visualization.
   
    ''' mpirun -np 48 sxsort3d_depth.py --post_sorting_sharpen --output_dir='outdir_sxsort3d_depth_sharpen' ''' <<BR>><<BR>>

= Description =
sxsort3d_depth finds out stable members by carrying out two-way comparison of two independent Kmeans clustering with minimum group size constraint.

Important parameters:
--depth_order:  The parameter resembles the previous option number of independent runs but it controls sorting in an different way. The default value of 2 is a good choice.
--minimum_grp_size: This parameter selects qualified clusters and controls Kmeans clustering stability. The suggested value would be between img_per_grp/2 and img_per_grp but should be less than img_per_grp.
--stop_mgskmeans_percentage: Even though this option is not new, here the suggestion would be not to set it too small. 5.0 - 10.0  is a good choice.
--orientation_groups: It divides the asymmetric unit into the specified number of orientation groups and cast the data orientation parameters into them. It is meant to prevent sorting by angle, i.e., assign certain angle to one group, for example top views to one group and side views to another.
--swap_ratio: a ratio of randomly replaced particles in a group, it is meant to prevent premature convergence.

Results outputted:
1. in addition to selection text files and cluster maps in the main directory, anova analysis about defocus, smearing, average norm of particles in clusters are also given in log.txt file.
2. Sorting results (selection text file, maps, and anova analysis) are also outputted in each generation. Moreover, the highest numbered cluster in each generation is created from unaccounted elements, so it has a function of a trash bin.
3. The final assignment results are saved as Cluster*.txt in the main output directory.  The unaccounted images are saved in the last cluster file in the last generation.  

Test Results:
1. Simulated ribosome. 14400 particles with 64*64 image size belong to five even groups (all have 2880 members).  The command for this run is given in case 2 and it costs 10 minutes on our cluster with 48 cpus.
The sorting results.
group 1:   2448, 98% are true members 
group 2:   2493, 98% are true members
group 3:   2806, 98% are true members
group 4:   2883, 98% are true members
group 5:   2891, 98% are true members

2. Ribosome EMPIAR-10028: 105,247 particles with image size 360*360 with K=5 It took  about 13 hours using 96 CPUs of our cluster, which is about twice the time it took to refine this set. The command for this run is given in case 1.
We were able to sort out missing helix and missing domain. (See the attached movie and figure)

NOTE: 2017/12/19 Toshio Moriya
The following is old descriptions, and will be deleted in near future.

Important Outputs:
The results are saved in the directory specified as output_dir  ('outdir_sxsort3d_depth' in the example above). The final results are partitioned particles IDs saved in text files. Also, unfiltered maps of each cluster are reconstructed in the way of meridien does. One can use postprocess command to merge the two halves of maps of each group.

- Cluster*.txt: Sorting results. The number of cluster files is equal to the number of classes found. These selection files contain one column for particle indexes. Input projection EM data is assumed to be number 0 to n-1.
- vol_unfiltered_0_group*.hdf and vol_unfiltered_1_group*.hdf: Reconstructed halfset maps to be used for postprocessing.
- vol_final_cluster*.hdf 
- vol_final_nomask_cluster*.hdf  
- anova on defocus, number of smears, norm and statistics of micrographs of the final clusters and clusters produced in each generation are documented in log.txt.
- vol_final_cluster*.hdf, Cluster*.txt, vol_unfiltered_0_group*.hdf and vol_unfiltered_1_group*.hdf in each generation_00? directories. The last cluster is the unaccounted elements in each generation.

Restart: 
The current version supports restart program from interruption. User simply delete the unfinished nbox directory and state.json file from the interrupted layer and start the program with specified output_dir.

Some examples for timing: 
In general, reconstruction costs more than 80% of time for each sorting.
