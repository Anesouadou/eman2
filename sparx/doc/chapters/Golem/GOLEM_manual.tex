\section{GOLEM manual}
Commands in GOLEM are written on one of three possible levels:\\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Level 1 - commands that directly wrap C++ code.  These are usually simple image processing commands.\\ 
\\ 

\item Level 2 - commands written as a mixture of python and Level 1 commands.  They perform image processing tasks that require a number of distinct steps, such as 3-D reconstruction from projections.\\ 
\\ 

\item Level 3 - image processing tasks written as python scripts.  They perform EM-related tasks, such as 2-D alignment.\\ 
\\ 


\end{enumerate}
Classes of Level 1 and 2 commands:\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item FUNDAMENTALS\\ 
FFT, periodogram (power spectrum), cross-correlation, convolution, self-correlation\\ 
 center of gravity, \\ 
\\ 

\item STATISTICS\\ 
FRC/FSC, moments, entropy, center of gravity (again?!), SSNR,\\ 
 principal component analysis, t-test, Mahalanobis distance, correlation\\ 
 coeff, clustering, discriminant analysis, power spectrum\\ 
\\ 

\item FILTER\\ 
 FOURIER: top hat, Gaussian, Butterworth, hyperbolic tangent\\ 
 SPATIAL: box convolution\\ 
 NONLINEAR:\\ 
\\ 

\item MORPHOLOGY\\ 
 dilation, erosion, skeleton, edge detection\\ 


\end{itemize}

Clases of Level 3 scripts:\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item UTILITIES\\ 
 calculate average and variance files for an image series,\\ 
\\ 

\item 2-D ALIGNMENT\\ 
\\ 

\item 3-D PROJECTION ALIGNMENT\\ 


\end{itemize}
