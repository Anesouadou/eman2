= Name =
 Locally filter input volume based on values within the associated local resolution volume ([[sxlocres.py]]) within area outlined by the maskfile

= Usage =

''Usage in command lines'':

sxfilterlocal.py inputvolume  locresvolume maskfile outputfile   --radius --falloff  --MPI


== Input ==
    inputvolume:: first half-volume
    locresvolume:: local resolution volume (as produced by [[sxlocres.py]])
    maskfile:: mask volume outlining the region within which local filtration will be applied (optional)
     
== Output ==
    outputfile:: locally filtered volume.
    
== Options ==
    radius :: radius for the mask (pixels)
    falloff:: fall-off of the [[filt_tanl|tangent low-pass filter]] used by the program (default 0.1 in  [[absolute_frequency_units|absolute frequency units]])
    MPI:: use MPI version
