= Name =
sxpipe isac_substack - Create Stack Subset: Create virtual subset stack consisting from ISAC accounted particles by retrieving particle numbers associated with the class averages. The command also saves a list text file containing the retrieved original image numbers.


= Usage =

''usage in command line''

sxpipe.py  isac_substack  input_bdb_stack_path  input_isac_class_avgs_path  output_directory  --isac_class_id=ISAC_CLASS_ID  --no_virtual_stack

=== Typical usage ===

sxpipeline.py isac_substack does not support MPI. 


 1. Retrieve member :

''' sxpipe.py  isac_substack   bdb:test3  class_averages_generation_3.hdf  outdir_isac_substack '''


== Input ==
    input_bdb_stack_path:: Input BDB image stack: Specify the same BDB image stack used for the associated ISAC run. (default required string)
    input_isac_class_avgs_path:: ISAC class average file path: Input ISAC class average file path. (default required string)
    
    * The remaining parameters are optional.
	isac_class_id:: ISAC class average ID: Retrieve only particle members of the specifed ISAC class. By default, retrieve from all classes. (default -1)
	no_virtual_stack:: Do not create virtual stack: Use this option to create only the particle ID list text file associated with the ISAC class averages. (default False)

== Output ==
    output_directory:: Output directory: The results will be written here. This directory will be created automatically and it must not exist previously. (default required string)
