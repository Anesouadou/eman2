= Name =
sxwindow - Particle Extraction: Create a particle stack from a list of micrographs and particle coordinates.


= Usage =

''usage in command line''

sxwindow.py  input_micrograph_pattern  input_coordinates_pattern  output_directory  --coordinates_format  --box_size=box_size  --invert  --import_ctf=ctf_file  --limit_ctf  --resample_ratio=resample_ratio  --defocus_error=defocus_error  --astigmatism_error=astigmatism_error


=== Typical usage ===

sxwindow exists in for both MPI and non-MPI versions, but does not require --MPI flag.

You can specify a list of input micrographs and their corresponding coordinates using wild card (e.g. *). Running from the command line requires enclosing the string by single quotes (') or double quotes ("). sxgui.py will automatically adds single quotes to the string (').  BDB stacks can not be
 used as input.

''' mpirun  -np  32  sxwindow.py  './mic*.hdf'  'info/mic*_info.json'  particles  --coordinates_format=eman2  --box_size=64  --invert  --import_ctf=outdir_cter/partres/partres.txt '''

NOTE: Please remember to adjust box_size also when setting resample_ratio < 0.1.

NOTE: Passing a list of micrograph names as arguments is not supported since 2015/12/10


== Input ==
    input_micrograph_pattern:: Input micrographs: Wild cards (e.g. *) can be used to specify the list of micrographs. (default required string)
    input_coordinates_pattern:: Input coordinates files: Wild cards (e.g. *) can be used to specify a list of coordinates for the corresponding micrographs. (default required string)
    output_directory:: Output directory: The results will be written here. This directory will be created automatically and it must not exist previously. (default required string)
    
    coordinates_format:: Coordinate file format: Allowed values are 'sparx', 'eman1', 'eman2', or 'spider'. sparx, eman2, and spider formats use the particle center as coordinates. The eman1 format uses the lower left corner of the box as coordinates. (default eman1)
    box_size:: Particle box size [Pixels]: The pixel size is automatically recalculated when resample_ratio < 1.0 is used. (default 256)
    invert:: Invert contrast: Recommended for cryo-EM data (default False)
    import_ctf:: CTF parameter file: This file is produced by sxcter and normally called partres.txt (default none)

    * The remaining parameters are optional.
    limit_ctf:: Use CTF limit filter: Frequencies whose oscillation cannot be properly modeled at the current pixel size are discarded in the images with the appropriate low-pass filter. This option requires --import_ctf. (default False)
    resample_ratio:: Ratio between the new and original box size: Use values between 0. and 1. (default 1.0)
    defocus_error:: Defocus error limit: Exclude micrographs where the defocus error computed by sxcter exceeds the desired value. The error is computed as (std dev defocus)/defocus*100%. (default 1000000.0)
    astigmatism_error:: Astigmatism error limit: Set astigmatism to zero for all micrographs where the angular error computed by sxcter is larger than the desired value. (default 360.0)


== Output ==
The program creates the output directory automatically and inside a local BDB stack image is written for each micrograph. The files are named micrograph name with "_ptcls" suffix. For example, ''particles/EMAN2DB/mic0_ptcls.bdb'' or ''bdb:particles#mic0_ptcls'' 


= Description =
 1. Takes micrographs and coordinates as input and writes the particle images to a local stack.
 2. Normalization is done by subtracting the average of the region outside of a circle with radius half the box size.
 3. Micrographs are applied a Gaussian high-pass filter equivalent to the box size.
