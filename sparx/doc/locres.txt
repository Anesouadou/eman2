sxlocres - Compute local resolution in real space within are outlined by the maskfile and within regions wn x wn x wn

= Usage =

''Usage in command lines'':

sxlocres.py firstvolume  secondvolume maskfile outputfile --wn --step --cutoff  --radius  --fsc --MPI


== Input ==
    firstvolume:: first half-volume
    secondvolume:: second half-volume
    maskfile:: mask volume outlining the region within which local resolution values will be computed (optional)
     
== Output ==
    outputfile:: the output local resolution volume contains, for each voxel, an [[absolute_frequency_units|absolute frequency]] value for which local resolution at this location drops below the specified cut-off FSC value (only regions specified by the mask film or within a sphere have non-zero values).
    
== Options ==
    wn:: Size of window within which local real-space FSC is computed (default 7)
    radius :: radius for the mask (pixels)
    cutoff:: resolution cut-off for FSC (default 0.5)
    step:: shell step in Fourier size in pixels (default 1.0)
    fsc:: the name output file that will contain the overall FSC curve computed by rotational averaging of local resolution values (migh be truncated) (default no curve)
    MPI:: use MPI version
