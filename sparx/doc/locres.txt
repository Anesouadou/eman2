== Input ==
    firstvolume:: First half-volume: (default required string)
    secondvolume:: Second half-volume: (default required string)
    maskfile:: 3D mask: Defines the region where the local filtering should be applied. (default none)
    
    wn:: FSC window size: Defines the size of window where the local real-space FSC is computed. (default 7)
    step:: Fourier shell step size [Pixels]: (default 1.0)
    cutoff:: Resolution cut-off [1/Pixel]: Cut-off for the FSC. By default it goes to the Nyquist frequencies. (default 0.5)
    radius:: Mask radius [Pixels]: In case no mask is provided, a hard sphere of this radius will be used. (default -1)
    res_overall:: Overall resolution calibration (0 to 0.5). See Description below for details. (default -1)
    
    * The remaining parameters are optional.
    MPI:: Use MPI: (default False)


== Output ==
    outputfile:: Output volume: Each voxel contains the resolution for this area in [[absolute_frequency_units|absolute frequency]] units. (default required string)
    fsc:: FSC output file: Contains the overall FSC curve computed by rotational averaging of local resolution values. It is truncated to res_overall. (default no curve) 


= Description =
   Local resolution values are computed within small windowed areas (size wn^3). Due to small sample size the values are inaccurate and tend to underestimate resolution.
   Therefore, option res_overall allows to calibrate the average value of all local resolutions to the overall resolution, as estimated by the FSC between two full size volumes. I
   This value has to be independently obtained by the user - for example using sximgstat.py to compute (masked) FSC from half-volumes and reading the absolute frequency crresponding
   to 0.5 (or other) cut-off value.
