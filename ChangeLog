	* CMakeLists.txt: 
	    - there is no provision in  eman2/CMakeLists.txt
	      for user-defined root directories, e.g.
		  FIND_PATH(BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH boost/python.hpp
					    $ENV{HOME}/include
					    /usr/local/include
					    /usr/include)

	    - $ENV{GSLDIR} gives a way for custom gsl locations,
	      but for boost...

	Thus, I added the use of a generic EMAN2_PREFIX, analogous to the
	--prefix option in configure. 

	For boost (the headers), I added EMAN2_BOOST_DIST, which should
	point to the top-level boost directory.
	
	Lastly, I had emacs re-indent the file...
