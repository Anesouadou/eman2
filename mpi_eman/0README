While this document does contain information about this directory. The definitive version is in the
Wiki at :

http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/Parallel

This directory contains a Python module which will enable MPI support for EMAN2. It must be installed
using the already installed and configured MPI on whatever cluster you are using. There are a variety
of different MPI distributions out there, including OpenMPI, MPICH, LAM, etc. On some clusters the
specific MPI version in use is a commercial product that enables specific hardware features on the
cluster, and if a different MPI is used, it will perform poorly. For this reason, you MUST read
about the MPI installation on your cluster and find out how things are configured. In some cases
it may be possible for you to install your own MPI installation in your home directory if there
is some problem with the existing MPI on your cluster, but this is generally frowned upon, and
you should probably communicate with your cluster administrators before going this route.

Mac:
The Mac binary release already includes the necessary driver. NO FURTHER ACTION IS NECESSARY TO USE
MPI. If you are compiling from source on the Mac, the provided Mac makefile should work. Simply:

make -f Makefile.osx install

Windows:
MPI parallelism under Windows is not supported at the moment. Under windows you will need to 
use one of the other 2 parallelism methods. 

Linux:
This is the tricky one, since there are so many different variants of linux and so many different
MPI implementations. We have provided a couple of sample makefiles for different linux distributions.
Hopefully one of these will work for you. If not, you may need to make small modifications to
this makefile, perhaps in consultation with your cluster administrator. In general, try:

make -f Makefile.linux install

If you get an error, try one of the others. There may also be more advice on the Wiki page
referenced above.
