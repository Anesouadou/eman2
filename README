EMAN2 README

How to install EMAN2
    see instructions in INSTALL.

Where is the documentation

    EMAN2 has 2 levels of documentations:
    1) The basic documentation. It is under 'doc' directory.
    
    2) The code-based documentation.
       EMAN2 use Doxygen to maintain its code-embedded documentations. To
       generate the Doxygen-based documentation, run:
	 % sh makedoc.sh

What's the coding style of EMAN2
    1) EMAN2 follows the GNU coding style with minor differences. We use
       GNU indent to make the proper indentation. The indent options are:
       -br -nce -i4  -npcs -nprs  -npsl -l100  -ts4

    2) The naming styles are:
       a) All source code files use lower cases.
       b) All classes and data types use uppercase in the first letter.
       c) All functions use lower cases with '_' as the word separator.
	 
How do I make my code to follow the EMAN2 coding style
    Suppose your code is in file 'input.cpp', then run:
      % indent -br -nce -i4  -npcs -nprs  -npsl -l100  -ts4 input.cpp -o output.cpp
    The output is saved in 'output.cpp'.
