EMAN2 README

How to install EMAN2
    see instructions in INSTALL.

What is the file structure for EMAN2 source code

  - libEM       core libEM library
  - libpyEM     boost python wrapper of libEM
  - programs    command-line programs
  - utils       utility-level programs
  - pyemtbx     python library modules toolbox
  - plugins     templates and sample code for EMAN2 developments
  - doc         documentation
  - rt          regression tests
  
Where is the documentation

    EMAN2 has 2 levels of documentations:
    1) The basic documentation. It is under 'doc' directory.
    
    2) The code-based documentation.
       EMAN2 uses Doxygen (ver 1.4.3+ prefered) to maintain its code-embedded 
       documentations. To generate the Doxygen-based documentation, run:
         % sh makedoc.sh

What's the coding style of EMAN2
    1) EMAN2 follows the GNU coding style with minor differences. We use
       GNU indent to make the proper indentation. The indent options are:
       -br -nce -i4  -npcs -nprs  -npsl -l100  -ts4

    2) The naming styles are:
       a) All source code files use lower cases.
       b) All classes and data types use uppercase in the first letter.
       c) All functions use lower cases with '_' as the word separator.
     
How do I make my code to follow the EMAN2 coding style
    Suppose your code is in file 'input.cpp', then run:
      % indent -br -nce -i4  -npcs -nprs  -npsl -l100  -ts4 input.cpp -o output.cpp
    The output is saved in 'output.cpp'.
