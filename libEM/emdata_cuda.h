	/** Class CudaDataLock is a very basic object that you can use to
	 * temporarily 'lock' the cached cuda data (that is associated with a particular
	 * EMData), thus preventing it from being deleted inadvertently (see the CudaCache).
	 * When an object of this type is destructed it automatically unlocks the
	 * associated data. 
	 * The following code demontrates use of this object
	 *@code
	 *    {
     *    EMData e("something.mrc"); 
     *    e.set_gpu_rw_current(); // Copy data to GPU
     *    CudaDataLock tmp_lock(&e); // GPU data is locked
     *    EMData f("somethingelse.mrc");
     * 	  f.set_gpu_rw_current(); // This could have inadvertently deleted e's GPU data if it was not locked
     *    // Cuda processing
     *    }// tmp_lock is destructed as it goes out of scope ( which unlocks e's CUDA data) 
     *@endcode
     * You could achieve the same thing using the EMData member functions cuda_lock and cuda_unlock,
     * demonstrated as follows
     * @code
     *    e.cuda_lock()
     *    // processing
	 *    e.cuda_unlock()
	 * @endcode
	 * 
	 * Thoughts: The need for locking is due solely to the CudaCache, which would indiscriminately devour
	 * whatever occupied the next slot if there were no mechanism for stopping it. Is there a better solution?
