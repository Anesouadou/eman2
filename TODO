// TODO List for EMAN2

--- High Priority ---

  001: convert CCTBX float array to EMData

  003: command-line program logger (.eman2.log)
       We need to adopt a standard history mechanism like in EMAN1. Any
       command-line program should make an entry in a .eman2logfile when it
       starts and another when it completes. In addition to the process id used
       in EMAN1, we should also store some sort of machine identifier (for
       runpar-style processing with a shared filesystem). I think we can drop the
       file storage access lines.

       In general there should be an EMAN2 startup routine called (both python
       and C) as soon as a program gets past the argument parsing. This startup
       routine will handle the logfile thing, and we may use for other tasks
       later on...


  005: fix place where assuming EMData is only 2D or 3D. 1D is also OK. 4D?

  009: build a regression test system to call all the unit tests.

  017. write a documentation on how to use Filters etc. The doc may be
       generated by a script by passing the code.

  020: investigate EMAN2 GUI tools: QT PyQT Python etc

  022. cannot call calc_ccf with 2 args. has to pass the 3rd one as None
  
  023. calc_ccf isn't working properly. It's producing
	   the wrong results, and even more troubling, it seems that it is modifying
	   one of the input images.  a=b.calc_ccf(c,True,None)  modifies c in some
	   way. The result seems to be phase shifted vertically, but not
	   horizontally. Needs a careful look...

 
--- Low Priority ---

  008: fix bug: EMUtil.dump_filters() in boty python and document.
  

  010: use 'goodf()' to check floating number in FileIO routines.

  011. implement a callback mechanism so that if the image data is changed in
	   memory, the image display GUI can be updated automatically, either from
	   python GUI or C++ GUI.

  012. Implement 3D Convex Mask in image read/write and image processing.
	   ImageIO, Filter, and EMData.
   
  013. ImageIO: read with average/shrink

  014. Filter: Handle image edge in filters nicely

  015. Rotation Euler: return a list of possible angles in an asymmetric unit.
	   refer project3d() for impl

  016. EMData class: get_clip() , get 2D from 3D, 3D from 2D?


--- Items Done ----

  7/22/04: 007: add a tutorial on how to use boost python 
  
  7/25/04: 002: EMData API: define a generic way to replace the trivial
				get/set() functions.
       
  7/27/04: 006: EMData: define a function that can return a sorted list of
				all pixel values above a specified value. 
  7/27/04: 004: standardize the Size, Point class using "x", "y", "z" as data
				members. defines index accessing like point[1], point[2], etc.

  7/28/04: 018: change 'spacing_row' to 'apix_x'; 'spacing_col' to 'apix_y';
				'spacing_sec' to 'apix_z'.

  7/30/04: 019: when writing to an existing single-image like mrc, simply overwrite
		   it instead of checking its image size to be the same.
	   
  7/31/04: 021: python part doesn't compile sometimes on mandrake 10
