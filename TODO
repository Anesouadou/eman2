// TODO List for EMAN2

--- High Priority ---

  003: command-line program logger (.eman2.log)
       We need to adopt a standard history mechanism like in EMAN1. Any
       command-line program should make an entry in a .eman2logfile when it
       starts and another when it completes. In addition to the process id used
       in EMAN1, we should also store some sort of machine identifier (for
       runpar-style processing with a shared filesystem). I think we can drop the
       file storage access lines.

       In general there should be an EMAN2 startup routine called (both python
       and C) as soon as a program gets past the argument parsing. This startup
       routine will handle the logfile thing, and we may use for other tasks
       later on...

  005: fix place where assuming EMData is only 2D or 3D. 1D is also OK. 4D?

  009: build a regression test system to call all the unit tests.

  020: investigate EMAN2 GUI tools: QT PyQT WxPython etc

  023. calc_ccf isn't working properly. It's producing
	   the wrong results, and even more troubling, it seems that it is modifying
	   one of the input images.  a=b.calc_ccf(c,True,None)  modifies c in some
	   way. The result seems to be phase shifted vertically, but not
	   horizontally. Needs a careful look...
	   
  028. add region write to ImageIO. The first thing is to change the
       API. The real implementation may come in the future.

  029. use the new log API for entering/exiting functions. i.e., use
       ENTERFUNC and EXITFUNC macros to replace LOGDEBUG("...").
	   
  030. Filter naming convention change. Right now, filters that do similar
       things have very different names. I'd like to suggest that the most
       general word go first, ie:

	   GaussMask -> MaskGauss
	   SharpMask -> MaskSharp

	   StdNormalize -> NormalizeStd
	   EdgeMeanNormalize -> NormalizeEdgeMean

  031. Fix the documentation for 2 things:
	   1) new logging API;
	   2) new filter name conventions.
	   

--- Low Priority ---

  010: use 'goodf()' to check floating number in FileIO routines.

  011. implement a callback mechanism so that if the image data is changed in
	   memory, the image display GUI can be updated automatically, either from
	   python GUI or C++ GUI.

  012. Implement 3D Convex Mask in image read/write and image processing.
	   ImageIO, Filter, and EMData.
   
  013. ImageIO: read with average/shrink

  014. Filter: Handle image edge in filters nicely

  015. Rotation Euler: return a list of possible angles in an asymmetric unit.
	   refer project3d() for impl

  016. EMData class: get_clip() , get 2D from 3D, 3D from 2D?


--- Items Done ----

  7/22/04: 007: add a tutorial on how to use boost python 
  
  7/25/04: 002: EMData API: define a generic way to replace the trivial
				get/set() functions.
       
  7/27/04: 006: EMData: define a function that can return a sorted list of
				all pixel values above a specified value. 
  7/27/04: 004: standardize the Size, Point class using "x", "y", "z" as data
				members. defines index accessing like point[1], point[2], etc.

  7/28/04: 018: change 'spacing_row' to 'apix_x'; 'spacing_col' to 'apix_y';
				'spacing_sec' to 'apix_z'.

  7/30/04: 019: when writing to an existing single-image like mrc, simply overwrite
				it instead of checking its image size to be the same.
	   
  7/31/04: 021: python part doesn't compile sometimes on mandrake 10

  8/3/04:  024: Matrix3f: multiply and division have wrong
				implementation. It shouldn't do element-to-element mult/div.

  8/5/04:  025: EMData get_clip() won't work sometimes.

  8/5/04:  027. Geometry: change class Size from only int to IntSize and FloatSize.
				In Region, use float origins and float sizes.

  8/7/04:  022. cannot call calc_ccf with 2 args. has to pass the 3rd one
				as None
  			   
  8/9/04:  001: convert CCTBX flex array to EMData
  
  8/9/04:  026. EMData: do_ift() has a strange problem. first run works. second run
				fails. both runs are identical. possible reason: fftw cache.
	   
  
  8/11/04: 017. write a documentation on how to use Filters etc. The doc may be
		generated by a script by passing the code.


  8/10/04: 008: fix bug: EMUtil.dump_filters() in boty python and document.
