// TODO List for EMAN2

--- High Priority ---

  001: convert CCTBX float array to EMData

  003: command-line program logger (.eman2.log)
       We need to adopt a standard history mechanism like in EMAN1. Any
       command-line program should make an entry in a .eman2logfile when it
       starts and another when it completes. In addition to the process id used
       in EMAN1, we should also store some sort of machine identifier (for
       runpar-style processing with a shared filesystem). I think we can drop the
       file storage access lines.

       In general there should be an EMAN2 startup routine called (both python
       and C) as soon as a program gets past the argument parsing. This startup
       routine will handle the logfile thing, and we may use for other tasks
       later on...

  004: standardize the Size, Point class using "x", "y", "z" as data
	   members. defines index accessing like point[1], point[2], etc.


  005: fix place where assuming EMData is only 2D or 3D. 1D is also OK. 4D?

--- Items Done ----

  7/22/04: 007: add a tutorial on how to use boost python 
  
  7/25/04: 002: EMData API: define a generic way to replace the trivial
				get/set() functions.
       
  7/27/04: 006: EMData: define a function that can return a sorted list of
				all pixel values above a specified value.
